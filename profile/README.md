## Projects

### :bulb: Learn the most known vulnerabilities

**From zero to hero:** the four-week event holds lessons and workshops two or three times a week on vulnerabilities and how to identify and take advantage of them.

### :mag_right: Hands-on learning

At the end of each presentation, you will have to solve challenges showcasing the presented vulnerabilities.
These will run as a CTF where you should find the flag and demonstrate your power.

Two CTFs will be organized, one in the middle of the summer school and the other at the end of it.
